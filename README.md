# User Guide: OWN GAME

## Introduction

Welcome to OWN GAME! This application offers four different games for an enjoyable gaming experience. Each game has its own unique gameplay and challenges. Whether you're a casual gamer or an avid enthusiast, there's something for everyone. Let's explore the details of each game:

## Game Selection Interface

When you launch the application, you will be presented with a main menu that displays five buttons, each representing one of the games. Additionally, there will be a button to exit the interface.

## Game 1: Tic Tac Toc (Morpion)

Tic Tac Toc, also known as Morpion, is a two-player strategy game. Each player takes turns filling a grid cell with their assigned symbol, either O or X. The objective is to align three identical symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player assigned with X typically makes the first move.

## Game 2: Snake

In the Snake game, your objective is to maneuver a snake and make it eat randomly appearing prey on the game board. Be careful to avoid obstacles along the way. Each prey eaten earns you a point, and the goal is to achieve the highest score possible. The snake grows longer as it consumes prey, but the game ends if the snake collides with obstacles, the game board edges, or its own body.

## Game 3: Slot Machine

The Slot Machine game is a game of chance that doesn't require any particular strategy or skill, making it suitable for beginners in the world of online casinos. The game's outcome is entirely dependent on luck. The slot machine results greatly simplify the task for players, as they can only win with the presence of their lucky star, represented by a golden apple with a 5% chance of appearing. If the golden apple appears, it awards 3 x 10,000 tokens. Other fruits and their chances and corresponding token rewards are as follows:
- Orange: 40% chance, 3 x 5 tokens
- Cherry: 25% chance, 3 x 15 tokens
- Pineapple: 20% chance, 3 x 50 tokens
- Watermelon: 10% chance, 3 x 150 tokens

To win, you need three identical fruits in a single spin.

## Game 4: Shooter

In the Shooter game, you control a character using keyboard keys. Your objective is to shoot projectiles to eliminate monsters. Each monster killed increases your score. Killing a mummy awards 20 points, while killing an Alien awards 80 points. Both the player and the monsters have health points. Comets fall from the sky, making the player's role more challenging. Colliding with monsters or comets reduces the player's health points. If the player loses all their health points, the game ends. However, as long as the player has remaining health points, the game continues.
